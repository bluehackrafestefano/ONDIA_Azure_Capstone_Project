Great question ðŸš€ â€” the core idea is to take the single-customer setup (one GitLab VM + one PostgreSQL DB + networking + LB entry point) and generalize it so you can deploy the same stack per customer, automatically, using loops or modules in Terraform.

Hereâ€™s the reasoning step by step:

ðŸ”‘ Single Customer (what you have now)

1 VM running GitLab CE.

1 PostgreSQL DB dedicated to that GitLab instance.

A public IP / Load Balancer for access.

ðŸ”‘ Multi-Customer Extension

The goal: serve many companies, each isolated in its own VM + DB pair, but still easy to manage.

Option A â€” Multiple Independent Deployments

Each customer = one separate Terraform workspace or resource group.

Pros: strong isolation, easy lifecycle management.

Cons: more admin overhead (managing many state files).

Option B â€” Single Terraform Project, Looped Resources

Use a Terraform for_each loop or a count to deploy N GitLab VMs + N PostgreSQL DBs, one per customer.

Each customer gets:

A dedicated VM (with GitLab installed).

A dedicated PostgreSQL Flexible Server.

All VMs are registered in a shared Load Balancer backend pool, so theyâ€™re accessible through the same LB (with path-based routing, DNS mapping, or just IP:port mapping).
