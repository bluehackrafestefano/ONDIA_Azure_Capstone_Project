# üöÄ Project-401: Grafana Service deployed on Azure VMSS connected to a Load Balancer, PostgreSQL Flexible DB, VNet Components, and Azure DNS deployed with Terraform using Azure Entra ID to manage identities.

## üéØ Description
This project demonstrates how to deliver **Grafana as a Service** on Azure deployed with **Terraform**.  

This project is deploying:
- A dedicated **VM** running Grafana  
- A dedicated **PostgreSQL database**  
- Access through an **Azure Load Balancer**  
- Authentication via **Azure Entra ID** (OAuth2)  

Possible to extend to multiple customers and turns to a **Grafana as a Service** product.

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture
- **Resource Group** ‚Üí groups customer resources  
- **Virtual Network & Subnet** ‚Üí isolated networking per deployment  
- **Azure Linux VM** ‚Üí runs GitLab CE  
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** ‚Üí external DB for GitLab  
- **Azure Load Balancer** ‚Üí front door for GitLab instances  
- **Azure Entra ID** ‚Üí provides secure login for users  

---

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform templates define the full environment  
- **Database Isolation:** Each customer has their own PostgreSQL database  
- **Scalable Design:** Easily extendable to multiple customers (VM + DB per tenant)  
- **Authentication:** Integrated with **Azure Entra ID** for enterprise SSO  
- **Extensibility:** Can evolve towards scale sets, Application Gateway, and modules for onboarding

## üîë Multi-Customer Options
- **Per-Customer Resources:** Each customer has their own VM, DB, and Entra app  
- **Terraform Modules:** Encapsulate customer deployments for easy replication  
- **Automation:** Inject credentials and settings with `cloud-init` or Terraform templates  
- **Advanced:** Use a multi-tenant Entra app with centralized identity policies
